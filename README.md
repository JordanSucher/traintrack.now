# traintrack.now

[traintrack.now](https://traintrack.now) is a tool for finding the current location of the rare new [open-gangway R211T trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R211_(New_York_City_Subway_car)#Open-gangway_trains) in NYC during their pilot program.

It maps GTFS data to custom hardware beacons using [OpenHaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/) and [FindMy.py](https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py/).

The site uses a Next.js front-end to display current location and a Python/Postgres back-end API to perform geolocation and GTFS mapping.
